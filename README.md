## Overview

This project aims to explore the relationship between various country features and CO2 emissions on a global scale. The dataset used includes information on sustainable energy, CO2 emissions, land area, electricity generation from fossil fuels, and international financial flows for clean energy. The analysis is conducted using Python, with Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly Express for visualizations.

## Data Exploration

### Land Area and CO2 Emissions

Initially, we investigated whether there is a correlation between a country's land area and its CO2 emissions. The top three countries by land area (Canada, United States, and China) were examined. Surprisingly, the analysis did not reveal a clear connection between land area and CO2 emissions.

### CO2 Emissions Analysis

Next, we focused on the top three CO2-emitting countries in 2019: China, the United States, and India. The analysis indicated that these countries are major contributors to global CO2 emissions, with China leading the list. However, the exploration did not provide insights into the reasons behind their high emissions.

### Fossil Fuels and CO2 Emissions

To gain a better understanding, we investigated the electricity generation from fossil fuels. The results aligned with CO2 emissions, showing that the top CO2 emitters are also prominent users of fossil fuels for electricity generation.

### International Finance for Clean Energy

In an attempt to identify efforts toward cleaner energy, we explored the financial support received by countries for clean energy projects. Interestingly, only India among the top CO2 emitters received noticeable financial aid for clean energy.

## Discussion Points

The project raises thought-provoking questions, such as whether countries with higher CO2 emissions should receive more international funding for clean energy initiatives. Despite the complexity of clean energy adoption, the data suggests a potential mismatch between high CO2 emitters and the financial support they receive for clean energy.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into the global landscape of CO2 emissions, highlighting disparities in clean energy funding among the top emitters. This project serves as a starting point for discussions on international efforts to address climate change and encourages further exploration of sustainable practices worldwide.
